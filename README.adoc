= Ticketing support dump schema

This repository contains the json-schema describing the format of ticketing support dump defined in the CN03/GT4 group.

The schemas are available in the `schema` repository, with `schema\ticketing_support_schema.json` being the root schema.

== Using this repository

The schema is the single file `schema/ticketing_support_schema.json`. Use it with your favorite tool, or integrate
it directly in your tools.

NOTE: it could be interesting to host the schema file somewhere, which would allow users to retrieve it properly.

The official json-schema website has a list of https://json-schema.org/implementations.html#validators[validator implementations] for different programming languages. Pick your poison.

WARNING: This schema is based on json-schema draft 07, so be sure to pick an implementation that can use this draft.

=== Quickly checking the validity of a json dump

There is a python script called `quick_validate.py` that will check any json dump file against the current schema.

- Run it directly with `python quick_validate.py path/to/file.json` (same requirements as tests)
- or through https://earthly.dev/[earthly] using `earthly +validate --file path/to/file.json`

== Running tests

=== Using Docker and Earthly

Any machine with docker and https://earthly.dev/[earthly] installed can run the test suite with `earthly +test` easily.

=== Manually

==== Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Python packages `pytest` and `jsonschema`

==== Running the tests

[source, bash]
-----
pip install pytest jsonschema
cd tests
pytest schema_tester.py
-----

== Writing new tests

Test files are themselves json files with the current schema:
